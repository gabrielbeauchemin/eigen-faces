This project is able to find the k most similar faces in the small database of a face image given in input. The algorithm use is the variance-covariance matrix to compare the images.

To do the comparaison, eigen faces are generated from the images of the database. See examples of eigen faces in the directory: /imn-tp1/eigenfaces/
